This is a fake data generator built with R and Shiny. 

Once operational, users will be able to:
-   specify variable names
-   specify variable types
-   choose from pre-set sample data such as dates ranges, names, phone numbers and lat/lon
-   force relationships between variables such as main effects and interaction effects
-   use dplyr mutate to create calculated columns
-   and more!
